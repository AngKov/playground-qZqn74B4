Let's do some pratice. A simple exercice. You have to modify this code according to this following rules:
 * The function `job` must returns a promise object (you are in a NodeJS environment, you can use `new Promise`)
 * The promise must resolve itself 2 seconds after the call to `job` and must give `hello world` in the data

@[Change the code to return a promise]({"stubs":["code.js"], "command":"node referee.js", "layout": "aside", "project":"part8"})
